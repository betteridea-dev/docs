# Template Marketplace

This is a collection of user published templates that you can use as boilerplate to quickly setup projects.

Each template is an atomic asset on the Bazar Marketplace and can be sold or traded easily.

Any project can be published as a template by clicking on the "Publish as Template" button in the project menu.
