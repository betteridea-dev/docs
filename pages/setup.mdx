# Development Setup

This is the speciality of our IDE, other than a browser, working internet connection and web wallet,
you dont need to have anything to build fully functional contracts.

### 1. Install ArConnect Extension

To start using BetterIDEa, you will need to have a web wallet setup.

For that we will be using the [ArConnect](https://www.arconnect.io/) extension.

### 2. Create a new wallet or import an old one

And we are ready to use the IDE :)
