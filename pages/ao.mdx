# More about AO

AO (Actor Oriented) is a new paradigm for developing smart contracts.
It is based on the idea that the actor is the fundamental unit of computation.
An actor is a computational entity that, in response to a message it receives,
can concurrently send messages to other actors, create new actors, update its local state,
and determine how to respond to the next message received.

To use AO on Arwaeve, we use the [LUA](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/) programming language.
