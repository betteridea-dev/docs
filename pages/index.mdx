## What is Arweave and AO?

[Arweave](https://arweave.org) is a decentralized permanent data storage network.

Recently, Arweave announced the release of a *hyper threaded computer* called [AO](https://ao.arweave.dev) on the Arweave Network. 

This is a big step forward for the Arweave Ecosystem adn web3 in general as it will enable developers to build hyper scalable smart contracts and DAPPs that was not feasible before.
